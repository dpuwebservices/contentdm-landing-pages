                        <p class="para">DePaul student journalists have scrutinized the University, and themselves, in the DePaul Poll Parrot (published 1923), the DePaulia (published 1923-present), and the alternative student newspaper The Altheia (published 1967-1971). Documenting campus activities, University administration, and the world beyond DePaul, each publication has its own unique perspective, ranging from The Altheiaâ€™s focus on social issues of the times, to the more traditional campus coverage of the DePaulia.

Digitization is ongoing, and will eventually include the entire run of each newspaper held by University Archives, up through the most recently concluded academic year. Gaps in what is available online may reflect gaps in the physical collection, or may represent editions that are still in process for digitization. Contact us for more information.
