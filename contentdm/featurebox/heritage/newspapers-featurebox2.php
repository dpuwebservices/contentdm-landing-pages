						<h3>The Quarter System</h3>


                        <p class="para no-padding">Ever since switching over to the <a href="http://digicol.lib.depaul.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16106coll4/id/2026/rec/30">quarter system in 1966</a>, DePaul administrators had been wondering how to schedule
						advising and registration. A proposed suggestion was to have registration during winter break in order to make finals less stressful for students. However, since registration was done in person, this caused a lot of problems for students 
						and advising staff.</p>
